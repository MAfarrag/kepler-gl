# Introductory Guide to Kepler.gl
_Prepared by Alyssa Lopez_

This resource was adapted for LEADR classes from [this](http://drstephenrobertson.com/blog-post/teaching-digital-mapping-with-kepler-gl/) tutorial.


## Basic Information
Kepler.gl is a platform designed for geospatial data analysis, making it possible to investigate trends on various geographical levels, including region, state, city, and county. A variety maps can be created (or compared) with filters and layering, such as points, networks, and chloropeths.

For Kepler to be able to make a map from data, there needs to be latitudinal and longitudinal information within your dataset. In some cases, a dataset may have latitude and longitude in one single column, separated by a comma. Kepler **will not** be able to read these values. For more information on the types of files and formats that Kepler accepts, refer to "Add Data on the Map" on the [user guide](https://github.com/uber/kepler.gl/blob/master/docs/j-get-started.md)

**Potential Data Sets**
* [Alabama Slave Interviews](http://drstephenrobertson.com/blog-post/teaching-digital-mapping-with-kepler-gl/) created by Dr. Robertson    
* [Alabama County Unemployment data](https://github.com/leadr-msu/kepler-gl/blob/master/AL-countyunemployment.geojson)
